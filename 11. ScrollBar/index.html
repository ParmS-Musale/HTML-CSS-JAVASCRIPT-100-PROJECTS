               <h2>OOPS CONCEPTS</h2>

### 1. **Class and Object**
- **Class**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.
- **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created.

### 2. **Encapsulation**
- **Encapsulation**: This concept involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data. Access to the data is typically controlled through public methods (getters and setters).

### 3. **Inheritance**
- **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism wherein a new class (child class) is derived from an existing class (parent class). The child class inherits attributes and methods from the parent class, allowing for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes. This facilitates the extension and modification of existing code without changing the original source.

### 4. **Polymorphism**
- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. This can be achieved through method overriding (where a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class) or through interfaces and abstract classes (where different classes implement the same method in different ways).

### 5. **Abstraction**
- **Abstraction**: Abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort by allowing the programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level. Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction in OOP.

### Benefits of OOP:
- **Modularity**: The source code for a project can be written and maintained independently of the other parts of the project. This is because a class is a container for a module.
- **Reusability**: Classes can be reused in different programs. Once a class is written, it can be used as a building block for different applications.
- **Pluggability and Debugging Ease**: If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement.

By understanding and utilizing these core OOP concepts, you can write more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
